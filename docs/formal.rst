To retrieve a list of random ingredients,
you can use the ``Sale()`` class:


The ``kind`` parameter should be either ``"meat"``, ``"fish"``,
or ``"veggies"``. Otherwise, :py:func:`lumache.get_random_ingredients`
will raise an exception.

.. autoexception:: lumache.InvalidKindError

For example:

>>> import cpanlp as p
>>> sale1 = p.Sale(quarter="Q4",amount=93.4,unit="billion dollars",growth_rate=13%,year=2022,segment="North America")
